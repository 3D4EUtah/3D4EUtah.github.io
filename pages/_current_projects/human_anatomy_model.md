description: "The Human Anatomy Team is building a to-scale educational anatomical model from real patient MRI, CT, and ultrasound data. Alex has spent hours segmenting and processing medical data in 3D Slicer and Blender, after which models are printed with elastic materials to mimic tissue properties and then assembled in a design that allows organs to be removed and replaced easily.
