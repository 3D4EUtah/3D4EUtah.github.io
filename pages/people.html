            <img src="/media/headshots/lucas.jpg">
            <p>Lucas is a third-year mechanical engineering major. He became fascinated with 3D printing after designing
                a water pump for ME EN 1000. When he isn't in the Protospace, you can find him skipping legs at the gym,
                keeping up his Duolingo streak, or being a foosball try-hard with his roommates.
