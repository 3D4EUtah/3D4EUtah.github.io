Excited by the idea of tearing apart old equipment, and finding useful components for future projects, Evan finds fun in stitching together new devices from old ones. Still new to 3D printing, Evan makes up for it with 3D modeling. Always eager to help, he wants to make sure people can design anything they imagine.
